        realized that its not beginners friendly which made me stop for a
        while.later on i saw an advert of ALT School Africa on instagram and my
        twitter which got my attention and i had to quickly register for a
        diploma in Front end engineering and i was given admission to the School
        of engineering and my track was front end.
